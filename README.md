-   Xcode 11.6+

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. It is in early development, but Alamofire does support its use on supported platforms.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Alamofire as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
.package(url: "https://github.com/DoubleNode/DNSBlankSystems.git", from: "1.9.9")
]
```

## Dependencies

-   DNSCrashNetwork v1.9.13+
-   DNSError v1.9.1+
-   DNSProtocols v1.9.76+
